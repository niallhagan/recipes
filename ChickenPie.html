                1) Pre-heat the oven to 200 degrees C (Gas mark 6)<br><br>
                2) For the sauce, melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add the flour and cook slowly over a low heat for 3 minutes, or until the mixture smells toasty. Pour in the chicken stock, turn the heat up and stir constantly until simmering. Add the cream and gently simmer until the sauce has a syrupy consistency. Add the lemon juice and tarragon. Turn off the heat.<br><br>
                3) In another pan, gently fry the chicken, peppers and mushrooms in a knob of butter for 5 minutes, then add to the sauce.<br><br>
                4) Butter an ovenproof dish large enough to hold the chicken pie mixture with room to spare. Add the chicken mixture to the dish.<br><br>
                5) Roll out the pastry on a floured work surface, to a thickness about 1cm. Place tehpastry over the filling and carefully trim the edges. Use the trimmings to make cut-out shapes to decorate the surface of teh pie. Cut a couple of air holes with a knife to allow the steam to escape. Brush the pastry with the beaten egg.<br><br>
                6) Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 25-35 minutes. The top should be nicely browned and the filing piping hot. Remove, allow to cool slightly and serve.<br><br>
