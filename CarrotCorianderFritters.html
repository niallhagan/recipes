                These carrot fritters are perfect for a quick lunch, especially with a watercress salad on the side. They combine the classic carrot and coriander flavours into a hot, crisp alternative to soup.<br><br>

                a good handful <b>carrots</b>, about 6, trimmed and washed<br><br>
                3–4 <b>spring onions</b>, both green and white parts, sliced<br><br>
                a good handful fresh <b>coriander</b>, roughly chopped, plus extra to serve<br><br>
                2 large <b>free-range eggs</b>, beaten<br><br>
                1 tbsp or so <b>plain flour</b><br><br>
                1 handful freshly grated <b>Parmesan</b> (or alternative vegetarian cheese)<br><br>
                a few glugs <b>double cream</b><br><br>
                <b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b><br><br>
                a few good glugs fruity <b>olive oil</b><br><br>

                1) Grate the carrots in a food processor, then place into a large bowl with the spring onions and as much coriander as you like.<br><br>
                2) Add in the eggs and the flour to bind everything together, followed by the Parmesan (it will melt and again will help to hold the fritter together) and, for a touch of luxury, some cream and stir well, seasoning to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.<br><br>
                3) Just before you fry it's worth squeezing some of the mixture together in your hands to ensure it won't fall apart when cooking. If you think it will, add either a little more beaten egg or flour, only just enough to stick them together.<br><br>
                4) Heat a large frying pan, add in the oil and form the mixture into thin fritters, so they will cook quickly. Fry for 4–6 minutes until golden-brown on both sides. Remember the golden rule of frying – don't play with the food too much, let the fritters form a crust before you turn them over. Serve straightaway scattered with more coriander.<br><br>
