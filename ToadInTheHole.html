                1) Whisk together the salt, egg, milk and flour until there are no lumps and leave covered at room temperature for an hour.<br><br>
                2) Preheat your oven to 200 degrees C and lightly roast the sausages in a little oil/fat until they are starting to brown.<br><br>
                3) Remove the sausages and add more fat, it should cover the whole of the bottom of the pan (or you won't get a nice crisp bottom). Heat in the oven then add the sausages and pour in the batter until it comes halfway up the sausages. If you are not making two toads, pour the leftover batter into another small tin with fat to cook a Yorkshire pudding. <br><br>
                4) Roast for 20 minutes, in which time the pastry will puff up and crisp.<br><br>
