                1) Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat, then add the onions. Season with salt, then fry for 5-6 minutes, stirring, until starting to soften and catching a little on the bottom of the pan. Turn down the heat a little and add the garlic, ginger and chilli. Fry for 3-4 minutes, then put on a plate to cool.<br><br>
                2) Once cool, put in a food processor with the peanut butter, natural yogurt and soy sauce, then blend to a chunky paste. Put in a large mixing bowl, then stir the chicken into it to coat thoroughly. Marinate for at least 30 minutes.<br><br>
                3) When ready to cook, heat the grill to high. Thread the marinated chicken onto skewers (discard the rest of the marinade from the bowl) and put on a foil-lined baking tray. Grill for 8-10 minutes, without turning, until the chicken is cooked through and any marinade is golden brown.<br><br>
